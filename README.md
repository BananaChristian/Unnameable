# Unnameable Compiler

**Unnameable** is a statically type, Ahead of time compiled modern, lightweight programming language written in C++. It is designed to be fast, minimal, and expressive.
It exists to make low level development **clear**,**accesible** and **fun** for everyone, especially for beginners and builders on modest machines.
Born from frustration with the complexity of C++, the strictness of Rust, and rawness of C, Unnameable aims to strike a balance **fast and powerful, yet simple and predictable**

No matter what youâ€™re building an OS, a game engine, or your first kernel 
you shouldn't need a PhD or wrestle with books just to understand memory management.

Unnameable is here to bring the joy back to low-level programming.

This project contains the core implementation of the Unnameable compiler written in C++. It includes a custom lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree (AST) builder, and a simple REPL for testing.
